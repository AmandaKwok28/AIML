# Group 11 Final Project

## Getting Started

### 1. Running the Demonstration Notebook
To explore our end-to-end pipeline, open the file **`/src/demo.ipynb`** and upload it to your Google Drive. All required paths are configured to run automatically once the appropriate Drive shortcuts are in place. Also note that in the `/src` directory, you will find the pdf of the run notebook which shows expected behavior.

### 2. Mounting Google Drive
The demonstration notebook expects two shared course folders to exist as shortcuts inside your **MyDrive** directory. Please add the following shortcuts:

- **Semester Project**  
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15R02_qnRCqamF0h8giZ69Rl8z-wwWhiR?usp=drive_link 

- **Global Health + AI Course Fall 2025**  
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tB9RO1Fq-DfNg9ST176I4LEBg1U_SG7S?usp=drive_link

Once these shortcuts are added, `demo.ipynb` will mount and access all necessary files without requiring any manual path edits.

### 3. Creating an OpenAI API Key
Our project uses the **OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini** model for cost-efficient natural language processing.  
To obtain an API key:

1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart  
2. Select **Create API Key** and follow the instructions  
3. Copy your generated key (format: `sk-...`) and paste it into the `api_key` variable in the notebook where indicated.

**Note:** Running the notebook typically costs **less than $0.50**, so adding **$1 of credit** is sufficient.


### Navigating the Repo
Most of our code is located within the Semster Project folder. The code within this repository was used to process our data prior to uploading it to the drive.
